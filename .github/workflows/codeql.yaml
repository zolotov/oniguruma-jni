name: "CodeQL"

# This workflow provides CodeQL security scanning for GitHub Actions workflows.
#
# IMPORTANT: To use this workflow, the repository owner must DISABLE the
# "Default Setup" CodeQL in repository settings:
#   Settings -> Security & Analysis -> Code scanning -> Disable "Default setup"
#
# Default Setup and custom workflows cannot coexist - they conflict with each other.
#
# NOTE: Java/Kotlin analysis is intentionally DISABLED because:
# - The project uses Kotlin 2.3.0
# - CodeQL currently only supports Kotlin versions below 2.2.30
#
# When CodeQL adds support for Kotlin 2.3+, java-kotlin can be re-enabled.
